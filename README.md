# Google Location History Stats
This repository is for a microproject of mine which allows the user to calculate their daily movement stats based on their Google Location History data. Given a Location History Zip file, this python program will calculate how far you have travelled by foot, in a vehicle, in the subway, by plane, etc. The results solely rely on the fact that you have had Google Location enabled on your portable device for the period of time that you wish to look into. Or simply select "All Time Stats" and see your total stats during every time period that Google Location was enabled.
